# dualstageopamp2
avsdopamp_3v3 is a twostageopamp or dualstageopamp.Two stage Op-Amp is one of the most commonly used Op-Amp architectures. It can provide high gain and high output swing. The two-stage refers to the number of gain stages in the OpAmp.
The procedure is to design a two stage CMOS operational amplifier and to do transient and ac analysis for the implemented circuit. In this design we used skywater130 pdk i.e., 130nm technology. The circuit was designed using esim tool.
The objective is to achieve specifications only using opan source pdk's.
