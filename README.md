# dualstageopamp2
avsdopamp_3v3 is a twostageopamp or dualstageopamp.Two stage Op-Amp is one of the most commonly used Op-Amp architectures. It can provide high gain and high output swing. The two-stage refers to the number of gain stages in the OpAmp.
The procedure is to design a two stage CMOS operational amplifier and to do transient and ac analysis for the implemented circuit. In this design we used skywater130 pdk i.e., 130nm technology. The circuit was designed using esim tool.
The objective is to achieve specifications only using opan source pdk's.

# Applications
ADC Drivers.

Data Acquisition and Instrumentation.

Power Grid Systems.

Motor Control.

Test and Measurement Equipments.

Imaging Systems.

High-Performance Audio Circuitry.
# Limitations
Need for common mode output voltage stabilization.

Compensation of common mode feedback loop.

Difficult to interface with single-ended circuits.
# IP usage
# Tools needed to view and simulate this IP
# 1. Ngspice
Ngspice is the open source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits. Ngspice is an open project, there is no closed group of developers.

# Installing Ngspice in Ubuntu 20.04
Open the terminal and type the following to install Ngspice.
$  sudo apt-get install ngspice
# 2. Magic
Magic is a VLSI layout tool.

# Installing Magic in Ubuntu 20.04
Open the terminal and type the following to install Magic

$  wget http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/archive/magic-8.3.32.tgz

$  tar xvfz magic-8.3.32.tgz

$  cd magic-8.3.28

$  ./configure

$  sudo make

$  sudo make install

# Steps to clone this git repository in Unix based systems for simulating waveforms.
Open the terminal and type the following

$  sudo apt install -y git

$  git clone https://github.com/devishivani19/dualstageopamp2.git

# Pre-Layout simulations
To run and view the waveforms, type the following commands after cloning in above step.

$  cd twostageopamp/prelayout/cir.

$  ngspice.

This opens ngspice shell.

Type the following in Ngspice shell and press enter.

ngspice 1 -> transientanalysis.cir
# Post-Layout simulations
To view the layout, type the following comand in continuation with pre-layout simulations,
ngspice 1 -> exit

This exits the ngspice shell.

In the terminal, type the following commands.

$  cd ..

$  cd ..

$  cd Postlayout2/Mags

$  magic -T twosatgeopamp.mag

The following is the layout for the two stage opamp

To run and view the post- layout waveforms, type the following commands after above steps in terminal.

$  cd ..

$  cd Desktop/shivani/vsemixedsignalflow $

$  ngspice

This opens ngspice shell.

To plot between frequency and voltage for the transient analysis. Type the following in Ngspice shell and press enter.

ngspice 1 -> twostageopamp.spice
